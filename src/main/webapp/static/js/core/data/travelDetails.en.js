        comment: "Good morning Viviana, Made it home safely last night (despite a gruelling journey). I want to thank you again for arranging this wonderful vacation for me. As I've mentioned before, I cannot say enough wonderful things about the service provided by Tour Guides, drivers and hotels. Beyond expectations. Peru is an amazingly beautiful and intriguing country. As are its people. So much fascinating history, expertly shared by the Tour Guides with love and pride. I can't wait to share this experience with my friends and family and I will certainly use PeruTourism for future trips to South America. Viviana, when I arrived at Calgary Airport last night, I discovered that I had lost my house and car keys. I may have lost them at the hotel, or they may have fallen out of my backpack on the flight with LAN Air. Would you be able to check for me, and if they've been found I can pay for them to be mailed to me? It's the car keys I'm most concerned about. Thankyou,Hazel",
        response: "Hello Hazel, I'm glad to see that you got home well and that you had a nice time in Peru. Thanks for let me know that you've enjoyed your trip. Furthermore we’d appreciate if you can write a few lines about your trip on TripAdvisor, or if you prefer on our Facebook fan page, we’d like to share it with others fellow travelers. I'm sorry about your keys, let me check with the hotel and the guide that took you to the airport the last day and I'll get back to you. Regards"

        comment: "Apreciada Viviana, Muchas gracias por tu mensaje. Realmente nuestro viaje fue magnifico. Todos absolutamente todos los representantes de tu empresa fueron eficientes  profesionales y  de gran apoyo.  Cada uno de los  guías, excelentes.  Las dos especialistas que nos atendieron tu y Diana, profesionales a carta cabal.  Vamos  a colocar un “review”  en TripAdvisor con todo positivo. Perú ha dejado una huella imborrable en nuestra memoria y Machu Picchu ha sido un sueño cumplido. Muchísimas gracias de nuevo Viviana. No vamos a dudar en recurrir a ustedes para nuestros próximos planes de viajes a Suramérica. (espero conocerte en persona, Diana nos dejó una magnifica impresión) y mi esposo y yo los recomendamos ampliamente. Cuidense que valen Mucho:) Elvia H-H. Para consumo interno de tu empresa nos gustaría hacer algunas observaciones: - Esperábamos en el aeropuerto algo que dijera un poco mas de información sobre quien nos estaba esperando y no teníamos claro que cuando Cóndor eran ustedes mismos o PetroPeru. Así que fui yo quien buscando aquí y allá pude detectar quien en realidad era la persona que nos esperaba anticipadamente. - Pensamos que debían tener el nombre nuestro en un cartel como las demás agencias. - El hotel Monasterio: Extraordinario en cuanto a arquitectura, organización y Excelente servicio. Sin embargo las habitaciones muy Pequeñas y no creo que queramos volver a reservar en el hotel Monasterio. - El resto de los hoteles:  ¡Excelentes!. - El viaje interno en el Perú de Lima-Cusco fue reservado en clase turista. La verdad es que nosotros viajamos en primera clase o “business” Se y admito que no lo aclaramos nosotros con ustedes.",
        response: "Hola Elvia, Gracias por tu respuesta! Me alegra mucho ver que tuvieron una excelente experiencia en Perú, me apenó no poder conocernos personalmente pero estoy segura de que habrá oportunidad en un futuro próximo. Con respecto a tus comentarios te comento que siempre nuestros representantes tienen un cartel con el logo Perutourism y con el nombre de los pasajeros, no lo tenía así la persona que los esperó? Lamento que el hotel Monasterio no haya estado a la altura de tus expectativas pero que bueno saber que los otros hoteles sí. En cuanto a los vuelos, no tenía conocimiento de que preferían business class, pero lo tendremos muy en cuenta para su próximo viaje. Saludos"

        comment: "Hello Viviana!  Thanks for checking in. Didn’t arrive home until late Friday night, and the weekend was spent reconnecting with family.  I did begin to compile pictures from my camera and phone, and just started paring down the 850+ total photos. We were very pleased with our guide, Ivan, who was knowledgeable, patient, and friendly.  It was a treat to have such personal attention!  I will heartily endorse and recommend him to others who want to experience what we experienced. We also enjoyed the meals that Jose, our cook, provided throughout our time on the Inca Trail.  His creativity and skill were much appreciated.  The porter staff, led by Mario, were all very gracious and accommodating, especially Claudio, who served us throughout the journey.  Both Mike and I felt like kids on a family vacation, simply showing up and waiting to be served!  Here’s a shot of us with the porter staff, taken by Ivan.",
        response: "Hello Steve, Thanks for your email! I’m very glad to know that the trip we organized was up to scratch of your expectations! That’s our main goal as a company and a great personal satisfaction for me ? Thanks for sharing your picture, if you have some others of you both at Machu Picchu please send it , it would be great to post it on our fan page! I’m sorry for what happened at the Hacienda Concepcion, I don’t know why the guide didn't call you before leaving. I’ll check this with them too so it won’t happen again. I’ve visited your blog, good to know you have one! I think it would be great to include an add on your magazine, please let me know the details so I can check this with our Marketing Manager. Thanks for your confidence in our company and don’t forget to let me know which card we can credit.All the best, Viviana Santillán"

        comment: "Dear Angelica, we are safely home. Home, sweet home. Thank you for helping us organizing the trip. Everything was working just magnificent. Condor travel provided us with very professional and reliable service; always on time everywhere, and it is not as usual as it might seem to, therefore we appreciate it very much. We noticed you were always on-line to help sort out any problem should it occur. We go through our experiences and photos and we will share it with you and your readers. The 40 USD I paid extra on purpose in Iquitos for the trouble my card caused. I already contacted the bank manager to find out what went wrong as there was sufficient ballance on both cards. With kind regards, Antonin",
        response: "Hello Antonin, Thanks for your reply! I’m very happy to know everything was according to your expectations. About the credit card it was not necessary for you to give us an additional, but thanks anyway! Please don’t forget to send me your favorite pictures! We hope you come back soon in the near future! J All the best, Angelica Vasquez Travel Specialist"
